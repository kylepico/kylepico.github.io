    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I’m a prospective <strong>May 2023</strong> graduate of Cornell University who is interested in finding work related to tech, law, and policy. My studies have focused on <em>Information Ethics, Law, & Policy</em> in Cornell’s Department of Information Science (B.A.) and I will also complete a minor in <em>Law & Society</em>.</p><br>

    <h2>Academics</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout my academic career, I’ve earned <em>Dean’s List</em> citations several times in the College of Arts & Sciences. The freedom of my course selection allowed me to take challenging yet thought-provoking classes and even those offered by the Cornell Law School. Here’s a short list of my favorite classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>LING 2223 - <em>Language and the Law</em></li>
      <li>LAW 4131 - <em>The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law</em></li>
      <li>PMA 4502 - <em>Film and Media Festivals</em></li>
      <li>HADM 4890 - <em>The Law of Internt and E-Commerce</em></li>
      <li>HADM 4300 - <em>Introduction to Wines</em></li>
      <li>INFO 4200 - <em>Information Policy</em></li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>Teaching Assistant</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of my studies, I received my first TA opportunity in Spring 2022 for Professor Kyle Harms’ INFO 2300 - <em>Intermediate Programming & Web Design</em> course. My passion for teaching and guiding students on the principles of web development earned me an <em>Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award</em> recognized by the Department of Information Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Fall 2022, I received another TA opportunity for INFO 1200 - <em>Information Ethics, Law, and Policy</em> where I worked alongside Professors Gili Vidan and Steven Jackson. In my final semester, I will return to work alongside Professor Harms in INFO 2300.
    </p><br>


    <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve devoted a lot of my time to the Cornell Food Pantry where I’m the senior manager running the student-led initiative’s fight against food insecurity. I serve as the secretary of Cornell Hunger Relief, a student organization focused on raising awareness of on-campus food insecurity and conducting several volunteering opportunities throughout the academic year, such as the Big Red Food Drive. From Spring 2021 to Spring 2022, I was the Social Media Manager for the Men’s Rugby Football Club in which I maintained the club’s online presence and assisted in the creation of the club’s website. Although stepping down from the position, I still take an active role in the club as an athlete.
    </p><br>


    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
      As a pre-law student, I aspire to be at the forefront of regulating technology. With its rapid advancement, a greater awareness of technology is indispensable to make the Internet and other innovations safe for everyone. In the field of law, I'm interested in antitrust and intellectual property. My major in Information Science was carefully curated to give me an exceptional understanding of how law, ethics, and policy relate to technology. I hope to get more experience in the legal/policy field where I can put my skills to the test.
